How to find the first (in terms of occurrence in input, not lexicographically)

Write the solution as a Java method, with the following signature:
  Character firstUniqueChar(String input)

For example:
  firstUniqueChar("find first non repeated character of a given String")
should return:

    Using HashMap to find first non-repeated character from String in Java.
        * Algorithm :
            * Step 1 : Scan String and store count of each character in HashMap
            * Step 2 : traverse String and get count for each character from Map.
            * Since we are going through String from first to last character,
            * when count for any character is 1, we break, it's the first
            * non repeated character. Here order is achieved by going
            * through String again. */
